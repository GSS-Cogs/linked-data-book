# Architecture

> TODO:
>
> - A chance to talk through some of the archetecture decisions we've made.
>
> - Our use of DCAT - a cube is a distribution of a dataset.
> - What qb ICs we ignore and why.
> - Long data vs. wide data, measure dimensions.
> - Can explain features we wished CSVW had e.g. custom @context. 
> - Reference data architecture - debates we've had around codelists.
> - OWL for harmonisation.
> - Versioning.
