# Welcome {-}

This is the website for the work-in-progress **"Creating Linked Open Statistical Data"**. This book will teach producers of data and statistics how to turn their data into [**5⭐ linked open data**](#what-is-linked-data).

Since 2016, the UK's [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS) have supported the [Government Statistical Service](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/) (GSS) in proving the potential for statistical data to be transformed into 5⭐ linked open data. Our goal is to encourage data producers to create and share their data in a way that is more interoperable and reusable by using open standards.

This book serves two purposes:

- To provide a practical guide for data and statistics producers to create 5⭐ linked open data by sharing our tools and methods.
- To share our experiences and application of open standards with the wider linked open data community, so others may continue to build upon our work.
