> TODO: Explain the chapters in this book.

## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

The beginning chapters are suitable for data and statistics producers with no prior knowledge of linked data, but with some basic knowledge of R or Python. For readers without programming experience, we recommend ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund as an introduction to the R statistical programming language. 

Later chapters explain our data architecture, use of open standards, and the issues and debates we've had along the way. Those already familiar with linked data and the semantic web may wish to skip ahead.
