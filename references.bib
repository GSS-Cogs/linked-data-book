  abstract="This chapter presents Linked Data, a new form of distributed data on the web which is especially suitable to be manipulated by machines and to share knowledge. By adopting the linked data publication paradigm, anybody can publish data on the web, relate it to data resources published by others and run artificial intelligence algorithms in a smooth manner. Open linked data resources may democratize the future access to knowledge by the mass of internet users, either directly or mediated through algorithms. Governments have enthusiastically adopted these ideas, which is in harmony with the broader open data movement.",

  ABSTRACT = {An important part of Open Data is of a statistical nature and describes economic and social indicators monitoring population size, inflation, trade, and employment. Combining and analyzing Open Data from multiple datasets and sources enable the performance of advanced data analytics scenarios that could result in valuable services and data products. However, it is still difficult to discover and combine Open Statistical Data that reside in different data portals. Although Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD) provide standards and approaches to facilitate combining statistics on the Web, various interoperability challenges still exist. In this paper, we propose an Interoperability Framework for LOSD, comprising definitions of LOSD interoperability conflicts as well as modelling practices currently used by six official open government data portals. Towards this end, we combine a top-down approach that studies interoperability conflicts in the literature with a bottom-up approach that studies the modelling practices of data portals. We define two types of LOSD schema-level conflicts, namely naming conflicts and structural conflicts. Naming conflicts result from using different URIs. Structural conflicts result from different practices of modelling the structure of data cubes. Only two out of the 19 conflicts are currently resolved and 11 can be resolved according to literature.},
